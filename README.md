# Food_Bunny

Project Name: FoodBunny

using Java and JavaFx Library

CSE 108 Project. Enjoyed every moment while working on it.

# Description

This is a food delivery app that allows users to order food from restaurants and at the same time allows restaurants to manage their orders. This app is built using Java in the backend and JavaFX in GUI.

# How to Run

1.Run the 'Server.java' file in the 'server' package.

2.Run the 'Main.java' file in the 'sample' package.

3.Once the app is running, you can login as a customer or a restaurant.

4.If you login as a customer, you can order food from restaurants and track your orders.

If you login as a restaurant, you can manage your orders.

5.Before running 'Main.java' file, make sure that 'Server.java' file is running.

# FunFact

If you want to run the app using 2 different devices, then you have to change the IP address in the 'Main.java' file in the 'sample' package to your system's IP address for the client system but not the server system. You can find your system's IP address by running the command ipconfig in the command prompt.

Then run the server side in one system and the client side in another system. Now you can use the app in both the systems. Make sure that both the systems are connected to the same network.
