# How to Run

1. Run the `Server.java` file in the 'server' folder.
2. Run the `Main.java` file in the 'sample' folder.
3. Once the app is running, log in as a customer or a restaurant.
4. While login as customer, you can use any name and password.
5. While login as restaurant owner, please check the **password.txt** file for credentials.
6. If logging in as a customer, you can order food from restaurants and track your orders.

# Fun Fact

If you want to run the app on two different devices, change the IP address in the `Main.java` file on the client system to your system's IP address (found using the `ipconfig` command in the command prompt). Run the server side on one system and the client side on another system, both connected to the same network.
